    steps:
      # 1) Checkout your fork (which now has all the code)
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2) Install Python 3.12
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'

      # 3) Install build tools, CMake, Ninja and CUDA‐enabled PyTorch
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel cmake ninja
          pip install torch==2.8.0+cu128 \
            --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

      # 4) Build the wheel in the nested folder that has setup.py
      - name: Build wheel
        run: |
          cd torch-cublas-hgemm             # <- this folder holds setup.py
          python setup.py bdist_wheel --dist-dir dist

      # 5) Smoke-test the newly built wheel
      - name: Smoke-test
        run: |
          cd torch-cublas-hgemm
          pip install dist/*.whl
          python - <<'PYCODE'
          import torch
          from cublas_ops import CublasLinear
          lin = CublasLinear(4,4,device="cuda",dtype=torch.float16)
          x = torch.randn(1,4,4,device="cuda").half()
          print("✅ PASS:", lin(x).shape)
